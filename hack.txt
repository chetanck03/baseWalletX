Build. Launch. Scale. Earn.

This summer, we're recognizing the most impactful onchain applications that bring people around the world onchain. The Onchain Summer Awards is a retroactive awards campaign designed to spotlight the most innovative, engaging, and widely-used mini apps and consumer apps across the Base ecosystem.

From July 9 to August 25, we‚Äôll be tracking key engagement metrics to identify and celebrate the apps and people that are leading the charge in bringing the next billion users onchain.
