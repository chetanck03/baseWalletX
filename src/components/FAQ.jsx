      question: "What makes WalletX's EVM Shared Seed technology revolutionary?",
      answer: "WalletX introduces industry-first EVM Shared Seed technology where one seed phrase generates identical wallet addresses across all EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain). This means your Ethereum wallet address is exactly the same on all EVM chains, simplifying multi-chain management while maintaining full BIP-44 compliance."
    },
    {
      question: "Which blockchain networks does WalletX support?",
      answer: "WalletX supports 6 major blockchain networks: Ethereum (Mainnet & Sepolia), Base (Mainnet & Sepolia), Polygon (Mainnet & Amoy), Avalanche (Mainnet & Fuji), BNB Smart Chain (Mainnet & Testnet), and Solana (Mainnet & Devnet). All EVM chains share the same seed phrase technology, while Solana uses dedicated Ed25519 cryptography."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is WalletX and where are my private keys stored?",
      answer: "WalletX employs enterprise-grade security with complete client-side cryptographic operations. Your private keys never leave your browser and are stored locally with encryption. We use industry-standard BIP-39/BIP-44 compliance, Web Crypto API for secure random generation, and zero data collection policy. All cryptographic operations happen locally using ethers.js and @solana/web3.js."
    },
    {
      question: "What are temporary wallets and how do they work?",
      answer: "Temporary wallets are like disposable phone numbers or burner emails, but for cryptocurrency. They're perfect for testing, development, privacy-focused transactions, airdrops, or when you need instant blockchain access without compromising your main wallets. You can generate unlimited HD wallets from a single seed phrase or create fresh ones as needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I import existing wallets from MetaMask, Phantom, or other wallets?",
      answer: "Yes! WalletX supports importing existing wallets using 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrases with full BIP-39 validation. Since we use standard derivation paths, wallets imported from MetaMask, Phantom, Trust Wallet, and other standard wallets work seamlessly. Your existing wallet addresses will be identical due to our BIP-44 compliance."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the multi-chain transaction system work?",
      answer: "WalletX provides comprehensive transaction management across all 6 supported networks. You can send native tokens (ETH, MATIC, AVAX, BNB, SOL) with custom gas/fee settings, switch seamlessly between mainnets and testnets, access integrated testnet faucets for free development tokens, and view complete transaction history with blockchain explorer integration."
    },
    {
      question: "Is WalletX completely free to use?",
      answer: "Yes, WalletX is completely free and open source under MIT license. There are no subscription fees, hidden costs, or premium features. You only pay standard blockchain network fees (gas fees) when making transactions. The platform generates revenue through optional donations and potential future premium enterprise features."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between mainnet and testnet, and why should I use testnets?",
      answer: "Mainnets are live blockchain networks where transactions use real cryptocurrency with real value. Testnets are sandbox environments with free test tokens for development and experimentation. WalletX includes integrated testnet faucets for all supported networks, making it perfect for developers testing dApps, learning blockchain development, or trying new features risk-free."
    },
    {
      question: "How does WalletX ensure compatibility with existing wallet infrastructure?",
      answer: "WalletX uses industry-standard cryptographic methods: BIP-39 for mnemonic generation, BIP-44 for hierarchical derivation, EIP-155 for chain IDs, EIP-1559 for gas fees, and Ed25519 for Solana. This ensures full compatibility with MetaMask, Phantom, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and all major wallet providers. Your WalletX-generated wallets work everywhere."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use WalletX for DeFi, NFTs, and other Web3 applications?",
      answer: "Absolutely! WalletX-generated wallets are fully compatible with all Web3 applications, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and dApps across all supported networks. Since we use standard wallet formats and derivation paths, you can connect to Uniswap, OpenSea, Compound, Aave, and thousands of other Web3 applications seamlessly."
